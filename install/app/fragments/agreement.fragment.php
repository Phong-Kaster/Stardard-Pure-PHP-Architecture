                <p>
                    This script uses independent and unofficial API. Official 
                    Instagram API is not being used in this script.  On the 
                    backend, the script behaves like official Android 
                    application of the Instagram.
                </p>
                <p>

                    use it for spamming, harassment, massive bulk messaging etc.

                    AS IT’S VERY CLEAR, THE SCRIPT DEPENDS ON INSTAGRAM. WE’RE
